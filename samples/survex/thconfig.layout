#!TITLE 40 Importing survex .3d files
#!FILE 1
#!
#! Therion surveys nearly correspond to station prefixes defined by
#! <code>*begin</code>/<code>*end</code> pairs in survex source files. Usually there
#! does not exist one-to-one mapping between them. So if you want
#! to keep your centerline in survex files you need to solve the
#! problem how to match survex and therion data structures. This
#! sample shows three different ways, how to deal with station prefixes
#! when importing survex .3d files to therion.
