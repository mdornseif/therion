#!SUBTITLE Using surveys specified in .th files
#! If you will import .3d file with <code>-surveys use</code> switch,
#! then therion tries to find the match between <em>survex prefix</em> 
#! and <em>therion survey name</em>. If this match is found, stations
#! are inserted into survey found. Otherwise prefix is left with 
#! station names. Example code:
#!CODE
import use.3d -surveys use
input use-out.th2
survey use
  input use-in.th2
endsurvey
#!ENDCODE
#! In this case you should take care where you input your .th2 files
#! containing scraps. In <em>use-out.th2</em> file you should refer to station names
#! using:

join use-in.s@use use-out.s
