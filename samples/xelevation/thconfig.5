#! The only thing that is missing is connection line between stations 1
#! in these two branches.

#! Therion does not automatically generate these lines because their
#! shape usually depends on particilar map. 
#! 
#! To draw such a line all you need to do is to create a simple scrap 
#! with this line. Here is an example:
source
centerline
  extend hide 5 5'
endcenterline
#!CODE
scrap sc -proj extended
  point 0 0 station -name 1 -from 5 -visibility off
  point 100 0 station -name 1 -from 2 -visibility off
  line map-connection
      0   5
      0  15
    100  15
    100   5
  endline
endscrap
#!ENDCODE
#! As you can see, even there are two stations with same name, they
#! are distinguished by <code>-from</code> option, which specifies
#! previous station in extended elevation. Using this scrap you receive the
#! final map:
map mc
  sc
endmap
endsource

select mc
select m
