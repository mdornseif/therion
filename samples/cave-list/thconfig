#!PROCESS
#!TITLE 4 Listing caves
#!
#! When surveying caves in some large area, you often need to generate 
#! an up to date list of all caves in that area. In therion dataset, "cave" 
#! can be defined in several ways, depending on the level of cave survey.
#!
#! If you have just surveyed entrance station (e.g. using GPS or standard
#! surveying methods), all you need to do is to assign <code>entrance</code>
#! flag using
source
  centerline
    fix cave-1 123456 789101112 1234
    fix cave-2 123333 789101122 1256
#!CODE    
station cave-1 "Unsurveyed cave" entrance
#!ENDCODE
#! 
#! If there is some explored passage behind this entrance, but you did not
#! survey it properly, you should add also <code>continuation</code> flag
#! and <code>explored</code> flag followed by explored length. Explored but
#! unsurveyed passage lengths are also part of summary statistics.
#!
#!CODE    
station cave-2 "Unsurveyed but explored" entrance \
        continuation explored 80m
#!ENDCODE
  endcenterline
#!
#! If you have properly surveyed some cave, its data are usually in some
#! <code>survey</code> structure. Survey becomes a cave, if it has main entrance
#! station specified using <code>-entrance</code> option. Example:
#!
#!CODE
survey small_cave -title "Tunnel cave" -entrance 0
#!ENDCODE

  station 2 "Second entrance" entrance

#!
#! If survey contains survey data, but it has no main entrance specified, it
#! is not considered as a cave, just as data organization unit and thus not
#! present in the cave list. Only surveys containing some caves (i.e. entrance 
#! stations or surveys with main entrance defined) are present in the final
#! cave list table.
#!
#! After caves in your data have been properly defined, you can generate
#! table using
#!CODE    
export cave-list -o caves.html
#!ENDCODE
#!
#! Resulting table looks like this
