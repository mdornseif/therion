therion:
 * statistics of explored but not yet surveyed passages. Just specify 
   `-explored <length>' to point continuation or add `explored <length>' to
   station flags and this length will be used in survey/cave statistics.

 * improved station flags handling. Added new flags for stations: sink, spring,
   doline, dig, air-draught(:winter|summer). Also `not' is supported before flag.
   User defined attributes may be added to stations using flag `attr' followed
   by attribute name and value.

   symbol-show|hide point flag:entrance|continuation|sink|spring|doline|dig...

   instead of replaced
 * added russian translations + encodings (thanks to Vasily Vl. Suhachev)
