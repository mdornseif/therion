\chapter Processing data.

Besides data files, which contain survey data, Therion uses a configuration file, 
which contains instructions on how the data should be presented.

\subchapter Configuration file.

The configuration filename can be given as an
argument to therion. By default Therion searches for file named |thconfig|
in the current working directory. It is read like any other therion file 
(i.e.~one command per line; empty lines or lines starting with `|#|' are ignored;
lines ended with a backslash continue on the next line.) A list of currently 
supported commands follow.


\subsubchapter `system'.
Allows to execute system commands during therion compilation.\[E.g. to open or 
refresh external PDF viewer.] Normally Therion waits until the subprocess is 
finished. If you want to continue compilation without break, use |command &| 
syntax on Linux and |start command| syntax on Windows.


\subsubchapter `encoding'.

Works like the |encoding| command in data files---specifies character sets.

\subsubchapter `cs'.

Specifies output coordinate system.

\subsubchapter `sketch-warp'.

Specifies which scrap warping (morphing) algorithm to use. 
Possible switches are |line| - the default, |plaquette| - invented by
Marco Corvi.

\subsubchapter `input'.

Works like |input| command in data files---includes other files.

\subsubchapter `source'.

\description
   Specifies which source (data) files Therion should read. You can 
   specify several files here; one per line. 
   You can also specify them using the |-s| command
   line option (see below). 
   
   It is also possible to type (some small snippets of) code directly in 
   configuration file using the multi-line syntax.

\subsubchapter `select'.

\description
  selects objects (surveys and maps) for export. By default, all survey objects 
  are selected. If there is no map selected, all scraps belonging to
  selected surveys are selected by default for map export.

  If there are no scraps or maps in the data, centreline from all surveys is 
  exported in the map.
\enddescription

\syntax
  |select <object> [OPTIONS]|
\endsyntax

\arguments
*  |<object>| = any survey or map, identified by its ID.
\endarguments

\options
  * |recursive <on/off>| = valid only when a survey is selected. If set
    on (by default) all subsurveys of the given survey are recursively
    selected/unselected.
  
  * |map-level <number>| = valid only when a map is selected. Determines
    the level at which map expansion for atlas export is stopped. 
    By default 0 is used; if ``basic'' is specified, 
    expansion is done up to the basic maps.
    {\it Note:} Map previews are displayed only as specified in maps in the 
    current |map-level|.

  * |chapter-level <number>| = valid only when a map is selected. Determines
    the level at which chapter expansion for atlas export is stopped. 
    By default 0 is used, if ``|-|'' or ``|.|'' is specified, no chapter is
    exported for this map. If |title-pages| option in |layout| is on,
    each chapter starts with a title page.
\endoptions



\subsubchapter `unselect'.

\description
  Unselects objects from export.
\enddescription

\syntax
  |unselect <object> [OPTIONS]|
\endsyntax

\arguments
  The same as the |select| command.

\endsyntax

\arguments
*  |<language ID>| = standard ISO language identifier (e.g. |en| or |en_UK|)

  * |base-scale <picture length> <real length>| = if set, Therion will
    optically scale the map by a (|scale/base-scale|) factor.
    This has the same effect as if the map printed in |base-scale| would be
    photo-reduced to the |scale|. (M, A)

    ASF (Australian Speleological Federation)\par
    CCNP (Carlsbad Caverns National Park)\par
    SKBB (Speleoklub Bansk\'a Bystrica)

    |symbol-assign <point/line/area/group/special> <symbol-type> <symbol-set>| = 
    display a
    particular symbol in the given symbol-set. This option overrides 
    |symbol-set| option.\par}
    
    If the symbol has a subtype, |<symbol-type>| argument may have one
    of the following forms: |type:subtype| or simply |type|, which
    assigns new symbol set to all subtypes of a given symbol.
    
    Following symbols may not be used with this option: point {\it section} 
    (which isn't rendered at all) and all point and line labels ({\it label}, 
    {\it remark}, {\it altitude}, {\it height}, {\it passage-height}, 
    {\it station-name}, {\it date}). See the chapter
    {\it Changing layout/Customizing text labels} for details how to change
    labels' appearance. (M, A)

    Group may be one of the following: all, centerline, sections.
    
    There are two special symbols: north-arrow, scale-bar.

  * |symbol-hide <point/line/area/group/special>  <symbol-type>| = don't display 
    particular symbol or group of symbols.

    Use |flag:<entrance/continuation/sink/spring/doline/dig>| as a 
    |<symbol-type>| to hide stations with particular flags 
    (e.g. |symbol-hide point flag:entrance|).
    
    May be combined with |symbol-show|.(M, A)

\subchapter Running Therion.

Now, after mastering data and configuration files, we're ready to run Therion. 
Usually this is done from the command line in the data directory by typing

|therion|

The full syntax is

|therion [-q] [-L] [-l <log-file>]
        [-s <source-file>] [-p <search-path>]
        [-d] [-x] [--use-extern-libs] [<cfg-file>]|

or

|therion [-h/--help]
        [-v/--version]
        [--print-encodings]
        [--print-tex-encodings]
        [--print-init-file]
        [--print-environment]
        [--print-symbols]|

\penalty-200
\arguments
  |<cfg-file>| 
  Therion takes only one optional argument: the name of a configuration
  file. If no name is specified |thconfig| in the current directory is used. 
  If there is no |thconfig| file (e.g.~current directory is not a data 
  directory), Therion exits with an error message.
\endarguments

\options
* |-d| =
  Turn on debugging mode. The current implementation creates a 
  temporary directory named |thTMPDIR| (in your system temporary 
  directory) and does not delete any temporary files. 

%* |-g| =
%  Using this option you can generate a new configuration file.
%  If |cfg-file| is not specified therion will use the |thconfig|
%  file. If the destination file exists, it'll be overwritten.
%  Generate a new configuration file. This will be the given 
%  |<cfg-file>| if specified, or |thconfig| in the current directory if not. 
%  If the file already exists, it will be overwritten.
%        
* |-h, --help| =
        Display short help.

%* |-i| =
%        Ignore comments when writing |-g| or |-u| configuration file.
%
* |-L| =
        Do not create a log-file. Normally therion writes all the messages
        into a therion.log file in the current directory.
        
* |-l <log-file>| =
        Change the name of the log file.
        
* |-p <search-path>| =
        This option is used to set the search path (or list of 
	colon-separated paths) which therion uses to find its source
        files (if it doesn't find them in the working directory).

* |-q| =
        Run therion in quiet mode. It will print only warning
        and error messages to STDERR.

* |--print-encodings| =
        Print a list of all supported input encodings.
        
* |--print-tex-encodings| =
        Print a list of all supported encodings for PDF output.

\subsubchapter XTherion---compiler.

XTherion makes it easier to run Therion especially on systems without a command 
line prompt. Compiler window is the default window of XTherion. To run Therion 
it's enough to open a configuration file and press `F9' or `Compile' button. 

XTherion displays messages from Therion in the lower part of the screen.
Each error message is highlighted and is hyperlinked to the source file
where the error occurred.

After a first run there are activated additional menus {\it Survey 
structure} and {\it Map structure}. User may comfortably select a survey or map 
for export by double clicking on some of the items in the tree. Simple click in 
the {\it Survey structure} tree displays some basic information about the 
survey in the {\it Survey info} menu.
